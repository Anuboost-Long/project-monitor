// Ad-hoc sign the packaged app so it opens on Macs other than this one.
//
// Notarizing needs a Developer ID Application certificate, which needs a paid
// Apple Developer Program membership. Without one, electron-builder falls back
// to the Apple Development certificate in the keychain — valid only on Macs
// provisioned for that team, so Gatekeeper reports the download as "damaged"
// everywhere else and offers no way past it. `identity: null` in the mac config
// turns that fallback off, and this hook signs ad-hoc in its place: still
// untrusted, but the block downgrades to the "unidentified developer" prompt
// the user can approve.
//
// This runs from afterPack, not afterSign — electron-builder skips the
// afterSign hook entirely when no signing occurred.
//
// macOS-only; a no-op on every other platform so the Windows/Linux build is
// unaffected.
